# Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to start up the backend and frontend of this project.

## Configuration

1. Download the entire project.

2. Open up two terminals from the project directory.

3. In one of the terminals, type "yarn start" and hit enter. This starts the backend.

4. In the second terminal, type "cd frontend", hit enter, then type "yarn dev" and hit enter again. You will be prompted to go to "http://localhost:3000/" which is the user entry point to the backend services.

5. Any username and password works as long as they are not empty fields.
